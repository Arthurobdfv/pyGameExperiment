# pyGameExperiment
This Repository Origins from a class from my graduation course, the purpose was to use all knowledge I developed up until this point of the graduation into one project.

## The Project
The chosen project will be a 3D game, the scope of the class was to use pyGame library but I decided to go one step forward and integrate pyGame with OpenGL in order to be able to run GPU in the rendering and to be able to build a 3D game.<br>
The project currently has 2 entry points, [\_\_main\_\_.py](__main__.py) and [\_\_main\_gl\_\_.py](__main_gl__.py), the first one is mainly to follow my graduation classes and get used with pygame library, while the \_gl__ version of it is my attempt to attach an OpenGL context into pyGame in order to have a more professional and efficient rendering engine.<br>
I am trying to generalize some of the classes used in the [\_\_main\_\_.py](__main__.py) code in order to be able to reuse those classes on the OpenGL entrypoint.
