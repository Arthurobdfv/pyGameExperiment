# pyGameExperiment
This Repository Origins from a class from my graduation course, the purpose was to use all knowledge I developed up until this point of the graduation into one project.

## The Project
The chosen project will be a 3D game, the scope of the class was to use pyGame library but I decided to go one step forward and integrate pyGame with OpenGL in order to be able to run GPU in the rendering and to be able to build a 3D game.
